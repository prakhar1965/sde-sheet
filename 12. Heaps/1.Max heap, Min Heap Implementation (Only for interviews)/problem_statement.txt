Problem Statement:
Implement the Min Heap data structure. For information about Heap  click here.
You will be given 2 types of queries:-
0 X
Insert X in the heap.

1
Print the minimum element from the heap and remove it.

Input Format :
The first line will contain the integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line will contain a single integer 'N', the number of queries.

Then, each of the next ‘N’ lines contains two types of query either 0 ‘X’ or 1.

Output format :
For each test case, output the answer for query of type 1 on a new line.

Note :
You don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= X <= 50

Time Limit: 1 sec

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case:-
Insert 2 in the heap and currently, 2 is the smallest element in the heap.
Insert 1 in the heap and now the smallest element is 1.
Return and remove the smallest element which is 1.

For the second test case:-
Insert 1 in the heap and currently, 1 is the smallest element in the heap.
Return the smallest element from the heap which is 1 and remove it.
