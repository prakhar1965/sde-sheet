Problem Statement:
You are given two arrays/lists ‘A’ and ‘B’ of size ‘N’ each. You are also given an integer ‘K’. You have to find the ‘K’ maximum and valid sum combinations from all the possible sum combinations of the arrays/lists ‘A’ and ‘B’.
Sum combination is made by adding one element from array ‘A’ and another element from array ‘B’.
For example :
A : [1, 3] 
B : [4, 2] 
K : 2
The possible sum combinations can be 5(3 + 2), 7(3 + 4), 3(1 + 2), 5(1 + 4). The 2 maximum sum combinations are 7 and 5. 

Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of every test case contains two integers ‘N’ and ‘K’ denoting the length of the array/list and the number of required sum combinations respectively. 

The second line of every test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array ‘A’.

The third line of every test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array ‘B’.

Output Format :
For every test case, return the maximum ‘K’ valid sum combinations in descending order.

Note :
You don’t have to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function. 

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= K <= N
-10^5 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^5

Where 'A[i]' and 'B[i]' denotes the ith element in the given arrays/lists.

Sample Input 1 :
2
3 2
1 3 5
6 4 2
1 1
3
4

Sample Output 1 :
11 9
7

Explanation of Sample Output 1 :
In test case 1, for the given arrays/lists, all the possible sum combinations are: 
7(1 + 6), 5(1 + 4), 3(1 + 2), 9(3 + 6), 7(3 + 4), 5(3 + 2), 11(6 + 5), 9(5 + 4), 7(5 + 2).

The two maximum sum combinations from the above combinations are 11 and 9. 

In test case 2, only one pair is possible with sum 7(3 + 4) from the given arrays/lists.

Sample Input 2 :
2
2 2
1 1
1 1
4 1
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1

Sample Output 2 :
2 2
8

Explanation of sample input 2 :
In test case 1, for the given arrays/lists, two possible sum combinations are : 2(1 + 1), 2(1 + 1).

In test case 2, for the given arrays/lists, one possible sum combination is: 8(4 + 4).
