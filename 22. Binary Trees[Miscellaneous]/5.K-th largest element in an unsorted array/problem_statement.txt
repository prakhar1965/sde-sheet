Problem Statement:
You are given an array consisting of 'N' distinct positive integers and a number 'K'. Your task is to find the kth largest element in the array.
Example:
Consider the array {2,1,5,6,3,8} and 'K' = 3, the sorted array will be {8, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1}, and the 3rd largest element will be 5.

Note:
1) Kth largest element in an array is the kth element of the array when sorted in non-increasing order. 

2) All the elements of the array are pairwise distinct.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two space- separated integers 'N' and 'K', as described in the problem statement.

The second line of each test case contains 'N' space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output Format:
For each test case, print a single integer denoting the kth largest number in the given array.

Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
1 <= K <= N

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
1
3 1
1 2 3

Explanation for sample input 1:
3 is the first largest element in the array {1,2,3}.

Sample Input 2:
1
4 2
5 6 7 8

Sample Output 2:
7

Explanation for sample input 2:
7 is the second largest element in the array {5,6,7,8}.
