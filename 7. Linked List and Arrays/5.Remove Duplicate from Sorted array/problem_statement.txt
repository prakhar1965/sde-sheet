Problem Statement:
You are given a sorted integer array' ARR' of size 'N'. You need to remove the duplicates from the array such that each element appears only once. Return the length of this new array.
Note:
Do not allocate extra space for another array. You need to do this by modifying the given input array in-place with O(1) extra memory. 

Input format:
The first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the number of elements in the array. 

The second line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers representing the elements of the array. 

Output format:
For each test case, return the length of the modified array.

Note:
You don't need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just Implement the given function.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= ARR[i] <=10^9

Where ‘ARR[i]’ is the value of elements of the array.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
3
1 1 2
5
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output 1:
2
5

Explanation of Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, Modified Array after removing duplicates: [1 2]. Thus the Length of modified array is 2.

In test case 2, All the elements of the array are distinct and so the array will be unchanged. Thus the length will be 5.

Sample Input 2:
2
5
3 3 3 4 4
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Sample Output 2:
2
10

Explanation of Sample Output 2:
In test case 1, Modified Array after removing duplicates: [3 4]. Thus the Length of modified array is 2.

In test case 2, All the elements of the array are distinct and so the array will be unchanged. Thus the length will be 10.
