Problem Statement:
Given a string STR of length N. The task is to return the count of minimum characters to be added at front to make the string a palindrome.
For example, for the given string “deed”, the string is already a palindrome, thus, minimum characters needed are 0.
Similarly, for the given string “aabaaca”, the minimum characters needed are 2 i.e. ‘a’ and ‘c’ which makes the string “acaabaaca” palindrome.
Input format :
The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then, the T test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case or query contains the string STR. 

Output format :
For each test case, print the count of minimum characters needed in a separate line.

Note :
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10 
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 5 
STR contains only lowercase English letters.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample input 1 :
2
abcd
dad 

Sample output 1 :
3
0

Explanation of sample input 1 :
For test case 1 : 
Minimum characters to be added at front to make it a palindrome are 3 i.e. “dcb” which makes the string “dcbabcd”.  

For test case 2 :
The string is already a palindrome, we do not need to add any character.     

Sample input 2 :
2
xxaxxa    
abb

Sample output 2 :
1
2
