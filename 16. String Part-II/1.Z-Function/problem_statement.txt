Problem Statement:
You’re given a string S of length N and a string P of length M. Your task is to find the number of occurrences of P in S in linear time.
For example:
If S = "ababa", and P = "ab", then "ab" occurs twice in "ababa".

Note:
The string only consists of lowercase English alphabets.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M, the length of string S and P respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string S.

The third line of each test case contains the string P.

Output Format:
The only line of output of each test case should contain an integer denoting the number of occurrences of P in S.

Note:
You don’t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, M <= 10^4

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:

2

Explanation of Sample Input 1:
In the 1st testcase,
"ab" occurs two times in "ababa". The first occurrence is from position 1 to position 2 and the second occurrence is from position 4 to position 5.

In the 2nd testcase, 
"code" occurs two times in "codercodes". The first occurrence is from position 1 to position 4 and the second occurrence is from position 6 to position 9.

Sample Input 2:
2
7 3
aababba
aba
6 2
