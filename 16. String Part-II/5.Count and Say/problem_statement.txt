Problem Statement:
Write as you speak is a  special sequence of strings that starts with string “1” and after one iteration you rewrite the sequence as whatever you speak.
Example :
The first few iterations of the sequence are :
First iteration: “1”
    As we are starting with one.

Second iteration: “11”
    We speak “1” as   “one 1” then we write it as “11”

Third iteration: “21”
    We speak “11” as “Two 1” then we write it as “21”

Fourth iteration: “1211”
    We speak “21” as “one 2, one 1”  then we write it as “1211”

Fifth iteration: “111221”
    We speak “1211” as “one 1, one 2, two 1” then we write it as “111221”

Sixth iteration: “312211”
    We speak “111221” as “three 1, two 2, one 1” then we write it as “312211”

You will be given a single positive integer N, Your task is to write the sequence after N iterations.
Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a single positive integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of iterations.

Output Format:
For each query print the string that represents the sequence after the nth iteration.

Note:
You don't have to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just Implement the given function.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 30

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2
1
2

Sample Output 1:
1
11

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
First iteration: “1”
    As we are starting with one.

Second iteration: “11”
    We speak “1” as   “one 1” then we write it as “11”

Sample Input 2 :
2
3
4

Sample Output 2:
21
1211
