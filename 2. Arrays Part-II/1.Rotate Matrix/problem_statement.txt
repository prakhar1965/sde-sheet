Problem Statement:
Given a 2-dimensional matrix of size ‘N’ x ‘M’, rotate the elements of the matrix clockwise.
For example: 
Input Matrix: [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] 
                [ 4, 5, 6 ] 
                [ 7, 8, 9 ] ]

Output Matrix: [ [ 4, 1, 2 ] 
                 [ 7, 5, 3 ] 
                 [ 8, 9, 6 ] ]

The output matrix is generated by rotating the elements of the input matrix in a clockwise direction. Note that every element is rotated only once. 

Note :
You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Also, update the given matrix in-place.

Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer 'T' representing the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two single-spaced integers N and M, representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix, respectively.

The next N line contains M single-spaced integers denoting the matrix elements. 

Output Format :
For each test case, the modified matrix is printed.

The output for each test case is in a separate line.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N, M <= 100
-10^5 <= data <= 10^5,

where ‘T’ is the number of test cases,  ‘N’ and ‘M’ are the numbers of rows and columns respectively and ‘data’ is the value of the elements of the matrix.
