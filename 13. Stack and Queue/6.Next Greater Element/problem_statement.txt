Problem Statement:
You are given an array arr of length N. You have to return a list of integers containing the NGE(next greater element) of each element of the given array. The NGE for an element X is the first greater element on the right side of X in the array. Elements for which no greater element exists, consider the NGE as -1.
For Example :
If the given array is [1, 3, 2], then you need to return [3, -1, -1]. Because for 1, 3 is the next greater element, for 3 it does not have any greater number to its right, and similarly for 2.

Input Format :
The first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. 

Then the T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N, representing the length of the input array(ARR).

The second line contains N single space-separated integers representing elements of the array arr.

Output Format :
For each test case, print a list of integers each representing the NGE(next greater element) of each element of the given array in a single line.

Note :
You are not required to print the expected output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input 1 :
1
4
1 2 4 3

Sample Output 1 :
2 4 -1 -1

Sample Input 2 :
1
4
9 3 6 5

Sample Output 2 :
-1 6 -1 -1

Explanation for Sample Input 2 :
For element 9, there is no next greater element. So -1 would be the next greater element.
For element 3, 6 is the next greater element. 
For element 6, there is no next greater element. So -1 would be the next greater element.
For element 5, there is no next greater element. So -1 would be the next greater element.
