Problem Statement:
Given a string ‘STR’ of length 'N'. Implement the atoi function. If there are no numbers in the string, return 0.
In other words, given a string ‘STR’ convert the string to an integer.
Example :
Give string : ”123456”, we return the integer value ‘123456’.

The string can contain any ascii characters. If the character in the string is not a number, ignore it.
Example :
Given string : ”#messi10”, we return 10 as other characters “messi” are not numbers hence we skip them.

Note :
1. If the first char is ‘-’ it represents a minus sign and hence we return a negative integer.
2. If there is no number in the string, return 0.
3. It is guaranteed that the number is less than or equal to 10^9.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.
Then the test cases follow.

The only line of each test case contains the string ‘STR’.

Output format :
For each test case, return the integer formed by the given string.

Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 50
0 <= N <= 3*10^3

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
4
12439
-43534
app546er
cutedog

Sample Output 1 :
12439
-43534
546
0

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For the first test case,
We can see that the string is a complete integer ‘12439’ so we return 12439 as an integer

For the second test case,
The first character is a ‘-’, which denotes negative sign so we need to return a negative integer, hence we return -43534 as an integer. 

For the Third Test case,
We have string : ’app546er’ 
Now we ignore all the non-integer ascii values and return 546 as an integer, here apparently ‘apper’ is ignored.

For the Fourth Test case,
We have string : ’cutedog’.
Now since the string has no number, we ignore all the characters and we return 0.

Sample Input 2 :
2
Apple
ban23

Sample Output 2 :
0
23

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
For the first test case,
We have string : ’Apple’.
Now since the string has no number, we ignore all the characters and we return 0.

For the second test case,
We have string : ’ban23’ 
Now we ignore all the non-integer ascii values and return 23 as an integer, here apparently ‘ban’ is ignored.
