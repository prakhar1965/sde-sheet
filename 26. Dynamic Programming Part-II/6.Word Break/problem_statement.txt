Problem Statement:
You are given a list of “N” strings A. Your task is to check whether you can form a given target string using a combination of one or more strings of A.
Note :
You can use any string of A multiple times.

Examples :
A =[“coding”, ”ninjas”, “is”, “awesome”]  target = “codingninjas”
Ans = true as we use “coding” and “ninjas” to form “codingninjas”

Input format :
The first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. 
Then the T test cases follow.

The first line of each test contains a single integer N denoting the total number of strings in A.

The second line of each test contains “N” space-separated strings of A.

The third line of each test contains a single string target. 

Output format :
For each test case, print 1 if you can form a target string else print 0.
The output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.

Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 5 
1 <= N, | target | <= 10^2
1 <= | A[i] | <= 10

Where | A[i] | denotes length of string i,| target | denotes the length of the string target and A[i] contains only lowercase English characters.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2 
2
ab cd
abcd
2
do the
hello

Sample Output 1 :
1
0

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, A = [ “ab”, “cd”], target = “abcd”
We can get “abcd” using “ab” and “cd”
So answer will be 1.

For the second test case, A = [ “do”, “the”], target = “hello”
We can’t make a target using one or more strings of A.
So the answer will be 0.

Sample Input 2 :
2 
2
aa a
aaaaa
1
do
d

Sample Output 2 :
1
0

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
For the first test case, A =[ “aa”, “a”], target = “aaaaa”
We can use “a” 5 times to get “aaaaa”.
So the answer will be 1.

For the second test case, A =[ “do”], target = “d”
We can’t make d using [“do”].
So the answer will be 0.
