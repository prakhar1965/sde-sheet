Problem Statement:
You are given an array/list ‘ARR’ consisting of ‘N’ non-negative integers.  You are also given a list ‘QUERIES’ consisting of ‘M’ queries, where the ‘i-th’ query is a list/array of two non-negative integers ‘Xi’, ‘Ai’, i.e ‘QUERIES[i]’ = [‘Xi’, ‘Ai’].
The answer to the ith query, i.e ‘QUERIES[i]’ is the maximum bitwise xor value of ‘Xi’ with any integer less than or equal to ‘Ai’  in ‘ARR’.
You should return an array/list consisting of ‘N’ integers where the ‘i-th’ integer is the answer of ‘QUERIES[i]’.
Note:
1. If all integers are greater than ‘Ai’ in array/list ‘ARR’  then the answer to this ith query will be -1.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases. 

The first line of each test case will contain two space-separated integers ‘N’ and ‘M’ representing the size of array/list ‘ARR’ and number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case will contain ‘N’ space-separated integers representing array/list ‘ARR’.

The next ‘M’ line of each test case contains the description of ‘QUERIES’. The ‘i-th’ line of these ‘M’ lines consists of two space-separated integers ‘Xi’, ‘Ai’ as described in the problem statement.

Output Format:
For each test case, print ‘M’ space-separated integer where the ‘i-th’ integer is the answer of the ‘i-th’ query.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.

Note:
You don’t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N, M <= 10000
0 <= ARR[i], Xi, Ai <= 10^9

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases, 'N' is the size of ‘ARR’, ‘M’  is the number of queries, ‘ARR[i]’ is an element of array/list ‘ARR’ and ‘Xi’, ‘Ai’ are the integers in ‘QUERIES[i]’.

Explanation of sample input 1:
In the first test case, the answer of query [1, 3] is 3 because 1^2 = 3 and 2 <= 3,  and the answer of query [5, 6] is 7 because  5 ^ 2 = 7 and 2 <= 6.

In the second test case, no element is less than or equal to 0 in the given array ‘ARR’.
