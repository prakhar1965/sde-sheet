Problem Statement:
You are given the schedule of N meetings with their start time Start[i] and end time End[i]. But you have only 1 meeting room. So, you need to tell the meeting numbers you can organize in the given room, such that the number of meetings organized is maximum.
Note:
The start time of one chosen meeting canâ€™t be equal to the end time of the other chosen meeting. Also for the same end time, a meeting with a smaller index is preferred. 

Input format:
The first line contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases or queries to be run. 

The first line of each test case or query contains a single integers 'N' denoting the number of meetings. 

The second line of each test case contains N single space-separated integers denoting the start time of N meetings respectively.

The third line of each test case contains N single space-separated integers denoting the end time of N meetings respectively.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the meeting numbers (Consider 1 based indexing) you organized in the given room, in the order in which you organized them such that the number of meetings is maximum.

Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= Start[i] < End[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For test case 1: 
You can organize a maximum of 4 meetings. Meeting number 1 from 1 to 2, Meeting number 2 from 3 to 4, Meeting number 4 from 5 to 7, and Meeting number 5 from 8 to 9.

For test case 2:
As all meetings have the same start time, you can organize only 1 meeting in the room.
